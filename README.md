### Currency converter

Just a simple currency converter written in python. 

The program will ask you of a base currency in which you want to convert from, ex: USD, BRL, CAD, etc.

Then you will be asked the amount to convert, you must type an integer.

Then you type the currency to convert to.

If you want to quit the program, just type q.

That's it.
